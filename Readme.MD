docker tag employee-department-eks:latest 779846797240.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/employee-department-eks

Tag and Push:
docker tag employee-department-eks:latest 779846797240.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/employee-department-eks
docker push 779846797240.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/employee-department-eks

3. Create ECS Cluster
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name employee-cluster1

 4. Create IAM Role for ECS Task Execution
Create a role -
aws iam create-role  --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --assume-role-policy-document file://D:\VATest\ECS\employee-department\ecs-trust-policy.json
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name ecsTaskExecutionRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

5. Create Task Definition
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://D:\VATest\ECS\employee-department\task-def1.json

6. Create ECS Service with Fargate + Load Balancer (optional)
aws ecs create-service --cluster employee-cluster1 --service-name employee-service --task-definition employee-task1 --launch-type FARGATE --desired-count 1 --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-0c06c9ba80675ca5b],securityGroups=[sg-03992897fd20860bd],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}"
